# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction

## About The Project
In this project, I have employed various regression analysis methods such as linear regression, ridge & lasso regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, XGBoost regression, and KNN regression by analyzing the outcome to obtain the best method to predict the air quality index.
