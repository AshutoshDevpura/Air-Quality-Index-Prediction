# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction

## Life Cycle of the project:

1. Data Collection using Web Scraping and third party API.
2. Preprocessing Data ( Feature engineering )
3. Feature Selection
4. Modeling
5. Hyperparameter optimization
6. Deployment using Heroku



## About The Project:
In this project, I have employed various regression analysis methods such as linear regression, ridge & lasso regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, XGBoost regression, and KNN regression by analyzing the outcome to obtain the best method to predict the air quality index. 

## Requirements:
This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Jupyter Notebook won't load on Github (sometimes)

In case the Jupyter Notebook doesn't load on Github, notebooks can be viewed using the below links for the respective regressors.
